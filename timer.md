Here's a possible Github CTF writeup for the "timer" challenge in PicoCTF2023:

# PicoCTF2023 Writeup: timer

## Challenge Description

You will find the flag after analysing this apk

## Solution Overview

To solve this challenge, we need to reverse engineer the `timer.apk` file to find the flag. Here are the steps I took:

1. Downloaded the `timer.apk` file from the challenge prompt.

2. Installed Jadx, an open-source decompiler for Android apps. A decompiler is a tool that converts compiled code (such as the code in an APK file) back into a human-readable format.

3. Ran the `jadx-gui` command followed by the name of the APK file to open the Jadx graphical interface:

   ```
   jadx-gui timer.apk
   ```

4. In the Jadx interface, I used the search bar to search for the string "picoCTF". This string is likely to be part of the flag, so searching for it can help us find the relevant code.

5. The search results showed me that the flag was stored in a Java class called `MainActivity`, in a function called `reverseFlag`. The relevant code looks like this:

   ```
   private static String reverseFlag() {
       return new StringBuilder(FLAG).reverse().toString();
   }
   ```

   This code takes a string constant called `FLAG`, reverses it using the `StringBuilder` class, and returns the result. Therefore, the flag is the reversed version of `FLAG`.

6. To get the flag, we need to reverse the reversed version of `FLAG`. In other words, we need to reverse the flag once again. The flag is:

   ```
   picoCTF{t1m3r_r3v3rs3d_succ355fully_17496}
   ```

## Flag

The flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{t1m3r_r3v3rs3d_succ355fully_17496}`.
