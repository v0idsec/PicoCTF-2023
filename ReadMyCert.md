## Challenge Description

How about we take you on an adventure on exploring certificate signing requests

## Solution

1. Download the CSR file.
2. Run `nano readmycecrt.csr` to open the file.
3. Decode the CSR file from Base64 using an online cipher tool like [sslshopper.com](https://www.sslshopper.com/csr-decoder.html).
4. The decoded text should reveal the flag:

```
picoCTF{read_mycert_41d1c74c}
```
